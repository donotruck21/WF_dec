             <h4>What are Databases?</h4>
           </div>
           <h5>A structured set of data</h5>
           <p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for
             creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are many
             different types of databases and they can be classified in a
             basic approach of relational database or non-relational database.
             Relationships means a set of our data is related to another
             section of our data. Meanwhile in a non-relational database there
             is not a common related section of our data. Our databases are
             put into sections of data called schemas, inside each schema each
             data set is organized into tables, those tables contain columns
             and rows to house that piticular set of data.
           </p>

             <h4>Storage</h4>
           </div>
           <img src = "images/harddrive.jpg" alt = "harddrive.jpg">
           <p>All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed on
             your harddrive, often times large companies will have floors upon
             floors of just database storage (think NSA styled). Our computer
             stores information on the harddrive, we are able to create new
             information, read information, update information and delete
             information.

             <h4>Searching</h4>
           </div>
           <img src = "images/database-search.jpg" alt = "database-search.jpg">
           <p>Since there could potentially be a lot of information a database
             stores one problem we might run into is finding the data we are
             looking for. Imagine we had a room full of books and you were asked
             to find the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well you might start
             picking up each book, checking the title and moving onto the next
             until you found it. Thats very slow as most libraries discovered.
             Instead if we were to ID each item we can find it quickly.

             <h4>Interactions</h4>
           </div>
           <img src = "images/dbinteraction.png" alt = "dbinteraction.png">
           <p>The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a storage
             bin that holds onto all saved data. well if only one user had
             access to that data its just like what we have built into our own
             computers, it wouldnt be useful to other users. However the joy of
             having a database is that it is a storage bin many users can
             interact with, creating, reading, updating and deleting information
             that all users would see.

           <img src = "images/database-companies.jpg" alt = "database-companies.jpg">
           <p>There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the storing
             of information. As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and
             amount of companies on the market. That being said a lot of their
             software is free for most users, think of MySQL, which while being
             an incredible DB is completely free of cost and is used by a large
             company called Facebook.
