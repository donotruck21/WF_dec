             <p>Computers connected to the <span class = "lBlueTxt">Web</span>
               are called <b>clients</b> and <b>servers</b>.
             </p>
             <ul>
               <li><span class = "lBlueTxt">Clients</span> are the typical Web
                 user's Internet connected devices (for example, your computer
                 connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile
                 network) and
                 <span class = "lBlueTxt">Web-accessing software</span>
                 available on those devices (usually a web browser like firefox
                 or chrome).
               </li>
               <li><span = "lBlueTxt">Servers</span> are computers that store
                 <span class = "lBlueTxt">webpages</span>,
                 <span class = "lBlueTxt">sites</span>, or
                 <span class = "lBlueTxt">apps</span>. When a client device
                 wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded
                 from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the
                 user's web browser.

             <h3 class = "blueTxt">So What Actually Happens</h3>
             <ol>
               <li>The browser goes to the
                 <span class = "lBlueTxt">DNS server</span> and finds the real
                 address for the <span class = "lBlueTxt">server</span> that the
                 website lives on.
               </li>
               <li>The browser sends an
                 <span class = "lBlueTxt">HTTP request</span> message to the
                 server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.
               </li>
               <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends
                 the client a <span class = "lBlueTxt">"200 OK" message</span>,
                 which means "Permission" granted! Here you go!", and then
                 starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series
                 of small chunks.
               </li>
               <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete
                 website and displays it to you!
               </li>
             </ol>

                   languages, the files that they serve to the client are
