				<h2>What are Databases?</h2>
				<h3>A structure set of data</h3>
				<p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating, manipulating, and deleteing data. There are manu different types od databases and they are classified in a basic approach of relational database and non-relational database. Relationships mean a set of our data is related to another section of our data. meanwhile in a non-relational dtatabase there is not a common related section of our data. Our databases are put into sections of data called schemas, inside each schema each data set is organized into tables, those tables contain colums and rows to house that particular set of data</p>

				<h2>Storage</h2>
				<img src="images/harddrive.jpg" alt="Hard drive image">
				<p>All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed on your harddrive, often times large companies will have floors upon floors of just database storage (think NSA styled). Our companuter stores information on the harddrive, we re able to create new information, read information, update ifnormation and elete information.</p>

				<h2>Searching</h2>
				<img src="images/database-search.jpg" alt="database searching image">
				<p>Since there could potentially be a lotf of infomation a database stores one problem we might run into is finding the data we are looking for. Imagine we had a room full of books and you were asked to find teh Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well you might start picking up each book, checking the title annd moving on to the next until you found it.  Thats very slow as most libararies discovered. Instead if we were to ID each idtem we can find it quickly.</p>

				<h2>Interaction</h2>
				<img src="images/dbinteraction.png" alt="database interaction image">
				<p>The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a storage bin that holds onto all saved data. Well if only one user had access to that data its just like what we have built into our own computers, it wouldnt be useful to other users. However the joy of having a database is that it is a storage bin many users can interact with, creating, reading, updating and deleteing information that all users would see. </p>

				<h2>Comapnies</h2>

				<p>There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the storing of infomration. As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and amount of companies on the market. That being said a lot of their software is free for most users, think of MySQL, which while being an incridible DB is compleetly free of cost abd is used by a large company called Facebook.</p>
