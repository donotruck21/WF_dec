				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting lsngusgr. JavaScript is extreemly popular for a variety of reasons. Itis a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic contorl over them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data avlues - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="blue-text">var x;</span></li>
					<li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="blue-text">var x = 10;</span></li>
					<li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Dat types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. there are six data types that are in JavaScript primitives: boolean - <span class="blue-text">true</span> or <span class="blue-text">false;</span> null - <span class="blue-text">null</span> aka nothing; number - <span class="blue-text">42 </span>or <span class="blue-text">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="blue-text">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="blue-text">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and object - <span class="blue-text">{first_name:'Jane,last_name:'Doe}</span></li>
					<li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="blue-text">if</span> a specified condition is truw, do this code in our code block; <span class="blue-text">else if</span> to specifiy a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="blue-text">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
					<li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeats an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
					<li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
