            <p class="bold">A structured set of data</p>
            <p>Databases are a collection of information. They are used for creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational database or a non-relational database. Relationships means a set of our data is related to another set of data. Meanwhile in a non-relational database, there is not a related common setion of data. Our adta bases are put into a section of data vcalled schemas, inside of each schema each dataset is organized into tables. Those tables are organized into rows and columns.</p>

              <p>All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed o your hardrive, often times large companies will have floors upon floors of just database storage (think NSA styled). Our computer stores information on the hardrive, we are able to create new information, read information, update information, update information, and delete information.</p>

              <p>Since there could potentially be a lot of information a database stores one problem we might run into is ifnding the data we are looking for. Imagine we had a room full of books and you were asked to find the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well you might just start picking up each book, checking the title and moving on until you find the book. That is very slow as most libraries discovered. Instead if we were to ID each item we can find it quickly.</p>

              <p>The amamzing part about having a Database is tta it is a storage bin that holds onto all saved data. Well if only one user has access to that data its just like what we have bult into our own computers, it wouldn't be useful to other users. However the joy of having a database is that it is a storage bin many users can interact with, creating, reading, updating, deleteing information that all usrs would see.</p>

              <p>There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the storing of information. As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and amount of companies on the market. That being said a lot of their software is free for most users, think of MySQL, which while being an incredible DB is completely free of cost and used by a large company called Facebook.</p>
